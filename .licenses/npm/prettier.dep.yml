    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%)
    or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n>
    \n> \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
    permissions granted by this License.\n> \n> \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred
    form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.\n> \n> \"Object\" form shall mean
    any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form,
    including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
    conversions to other media types.\n> \n> \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship,
    whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated
    by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example
    is provided in the Appendix below).\n> \n> \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any
    work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the
    Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
    modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.\n> \n> \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work
    or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion

    \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication
    on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems

    \n> \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
    within the Work.\n> \n> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
    to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
    form.\n> \n> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
    license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
    such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone
    or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
    was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
    incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
    then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n> \n> 4. Redistribution. You
    may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in
    any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
    that You meet the following conditions:\n> \n> You must give any other recipients
    of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n> \n> You must cause
    any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files;
    and\n> \n> You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
    of the Derivative Works; and\n> \n> If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file
    as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
    file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
    You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
    alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You
    may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
    of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your
    use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
    stated in this License.\n> \n> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
    without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
    may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n> \n> 6. Trademarks.
    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
    marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content
    of the NOTICE file.\n> \n> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
    provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
    OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n> \n> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
    of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
    stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
    damages.\n> \n> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
    for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
    You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
    each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
    such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n>
